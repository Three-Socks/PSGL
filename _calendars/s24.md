Calendar explanation:

For S24, we wanted to be big and bold. We've went for a calendar which has combined some of the trickiest circuits on the official 2019 Formula One calendar such as Azerbaijan, Monaco and Singapore.

We've taken into consideration of pad and wheel users, so there's something for everyone. The pad will be strong in Azerbaijan, Bahrain, while the wheel users will strike back in France and Canada. Examples of this can be shown throughout the calendar making for it to be a great season of racing.

As you've noticed, there's no Spa or Silverstone on the calendar. We decided these classics need a season on the sidelines, especially Silverstone where every lap is a DRS train with overtaking being very difficult.

This calendar is nothing like we've seen before in PSGL.
