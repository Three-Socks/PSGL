The time is here for PSGL to announce its plans, details and information for Season 27, which begins with FP on December 1

<!--more-->

Full dates and more detailed information can be found on our Discord server.

**League Structure**

Sign up depending, the league structure will mostly stay the same as Season 26:

Top tiers (assists restrictions) - Monday

Middle tiers - Sunday

Lowest tiers - Thursday

Performance tier - Tuesday

**Maximum number of tiers**

Given the large turnover of drivers in S26, our plan is to have a maximum of ten tiers. Depending on interest, no more than 11.

**Assist changes for S27**

To move in line with F1, our F2 league will also be no assists from Season 27 onwards. This is to allow a better promotion/relegation system and whoever in F2, who wins, will truly be deserving of a seat in F1.

F3, F4 and other Monday tiers will remain line only, for now.

Our Sunday and Thursday leagues will remain with assists enabled but we are cautious of drivers in F6, who use ABS, are capable of racing in F2/F3/F4, thus we encourage these drivers to turn ABS off and compete in our Monday tiers.

**Prize Money**

In partnership with Brutal Democracy Gaming, there is a prize pool structure for the coming season which affects our top two PS4 tiers - which remain free to enter.

Terms & conditions can be found on our Discord.

The prize structure will be as followed:

PSGL F1

1st - £160

2nd - £80

3rd - £60

**PSGL F2**

1st - £50

**Other platforms?**

There has been a lot of requests and interest in PSGL potentially doing an XB1 or PC tier.

In the immediate future, we are looking at potentially doing an XB1 tier - however there is nothing confirmed or certain at this stage.
