PlayStation Gaming Leagues on behalf of Brutal Democracy Gaming has taken the decision to remove Visceral Esports from the Trovo F1 Racing Series with immediate effect,



Once again, Visceral Esports has continued to show disrespect and an incredible level of hypocrisy in the way they conduct their business towards BDG and the wider community.



At the end of the day, business is business but people’s words should be backed up by their actions.



VSR’s assistant manager and I had a productive meeting several weeks ago to quash any dispute between the two teams.



Both parties acknowledged their own shortcomings, issues and subsequently came to the agreement that neither team would approach personnel from either team and ensure relations were good over Twitter etc. in the interests of everyone.



Over the weekend, CRG’s owner ‘Demon’ and I received messages over Twitter from two of VSR’s senior management apologising and hoped relations amongst the teams remained good and civil.



Unforutnately, these words ended up simply being thin air with VSR once again approaching one of the BDG drivers despite agreeing not to and in the eventuality that they would - they would at least approach me about it first and have a bit of respect - which is all we want.



Given BDG and Trovo’s financial contribution to the event, it has ultimate power to who and what races in such events. Given the actions of VSR and its inability to follow what it says, or ‘practicing what it preaches’, the following decision has been taken by BDG and PSGL.



VSR will subsequently be prohibited from taking part in the remainder of the Trovo Racing Series.



Should similar occurrences occur in the future, there will be further sanctions against VSR in future PSGL/BDG events or the main leagues themselves.



Ultimately, we are very sorry that some of the most talented drivers such as Vasterracer and Jordin will not be able to take part in the TRSF1, for VSR at least.



MNT (Team Mentalism) will replace VSR immediately, and will be given special dispensation to put forward a line up in time for Wednesday’s race at Silverstone, if possible.



Thanks,



Connor

PSGL F1 Director & BDG Esports F1 Manager
