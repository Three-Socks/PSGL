There will be a special custom points system awarding points from 1st to 20th, to give people a chance to fight to the very end and reward consistency.

Drivers from any league or tier can sign up, however, we may pick and choose who’s on the grid if too many F1/2 drivers sign up as we want a mix of drivers.

ILRT_Likkle will be in the charge of the event.

If you’re wishing to sign up. Please post your PSN and league in Discord #ce-signup

Thanks,

Connor
