**Season 25 is now over!**

Thanks everyone who’s raced, commentated and admined for the last season. 

In terms of views, attendance figures and so on, it’s our best season to date. 

With less than two months until the release of F1 2020, we will be beginning plans for the release of the new game and our new season - Season 26 - which is likely to be our biggest and best yet provided that Codemasters deliver.

Sign ups for next game will be done through Discord so please stay on the server. Information about the new season and sign ups will be posted here and on our Twitter - [@Playstation_GL.](https://twitter.com/PlayStation_GL/) 

If you have any feedback or things you’d like to see differently or changed then feel free to message me directly or say in the #psgl-general-chat. 

Once again, thanks everyone for your continued support and dedication to PSGL. 

Enjoy our off season events and of course, the break.
